- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Wide Reading Layout**: Article pages optimized for comfortable reading (1000px max-width)

## Pages

- **Home** (`index.html`): Main page with auto-loaded article list
- **About** (`about.html`): Personal information and research interests
- **Posts** (`posts/index.html`): Blog-style posts platform for thoughts and updates
- **Notes** (`notes.html`): Study notes, resources, and useful links

## Posts System

### Overview

The **Posts** section is a minimal, one-way communication platform inspired by Clarity Blog UI design. It features:
- Clean, centered header without the top toolbar
- Card-based grid layout for posts
- No interactions (no comments, likes, or user engagement)
- SEO-friendly structure with proper meta tags
- Google-searchable content
- Scientific, productive styling

### How to Add a New Post

1. **Create a folder** in the `posts/` directory:
   ```
   posts/your-post-slug/
   ```

2. **Add `metadata.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Your Post Title",
     "description": "Full description for SEO",
     "excerpt": "Short excerpt for the card",
     "date": "2025-10-06",
     "category": "Technology",
     "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
     "author": "Neksha DeSilva",
     "readTime": "5 min read"
   }
   ```

3. **Add `index.html`** with your post content (see templates in `posts/welcome-to-my-thoughts/`)

4. **Run the build script**:
   ```bash
   node build-posts-list.js
   ```

   This generates `posts/posts-list.json` with all posts auto-discovered.

5. **Deploy** — The posts page will automatically load from `posts-list.json`

### Posts vs Articles

- **Posts** (`/posts/`) — Informal thoughts, updates, reflections (blog-style)
- **Articles** (`/docs/`) — Formal academic work, research, detailed documentation

Both use the same auto-discovery pattern but different visual styles.

## How to Add a New Article

### Step 1: Create Article Folder

Create a new folder in the `docs/` directory (you can rename `articles` to `docs` manually):
```
docs/your-article-name/
```

### Step 2: Add Required Files

Each article folder needs two files:

1. **index.html** - Your article content
2. **metadata.json** - Article information for auto-discovery

### Step 3: Create metadata.json

```json
{
  "title": "Your Article Title",
  "description": "Brief description of your article",
  "date": "2025-10-04",
  "category": "machine-learning",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "author": "Neksha DeSilva"
}
```

### Step 4: Register in articles-config.json

Add your article folder name to the `articles` array in `articles-config.json`:

```json
{
  "articles": [
    "neural-network-architectures",
    "mathematical-foundations-deep-learning",
    "your-new-article-name"
  ],
  "baseFolder": "docs"
}
```

### That's It!

Your article will automatically appear on the homepage and in search results!

## To Rename `articles` to `docs`

**Manually rename the folder** from `articles` to `docs` in your file explorer. The config file (`articles-config.json`) is already updated with `"baseFolder": "docs"`.

## Article Template

Copy the structure from `docs/neural-network-architectures/index.html` for a complete template with:
- Bootstrap Icons (consistent toolbar)
- MathJax for equations
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Proper styling with wide, comfortable reading layout
- Fixed header padding and alignment
